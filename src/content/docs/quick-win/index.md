## What is Claude Code?

Think of Claude Code as a **super-smart assistant** that lives in your computer's terminal (that black window where hackers type in movies).

Instead of typing cryptic commands yourself, you can simply tell Claude Code what you want in plain English:

> "Create a simple website with a header, a photo, and three sections about my hobbies"

And Claude Code will:
1. Understand what you want
2. Write the code for you
3. Help you fix any problems
4. Explain what it's doing along the way

It's like having an experienced developer sitting next to you, ready to help 24/7.

But first, let's try something even simpler. Claude has a feature called **Artifacts** that lets you create things instantly in your browser.

### Step 1: Open Claude

Go to [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) in your browser.

If you don't have an account, you can create one for free in 30 seconds.

### Step 2: Ask Claude to Create Something

Copy and paste this prompt into Claude:

```text
Create a simple interactive calculator with a clean, modern design.
It should have buttons for numbers 0-9, basic operations (+, -, ×, ÷),
and equals. Make it look beautiful with rounded buttons and nice colors.
```

Press **Enter** and watch!

### Step 3: See the Magic

Within seconds, Claude will create a **working calculator** right in your browser!

  <div class="image-placeholder-text">

**Try it out!** Click the numbers and operators - it actually works!

## Try More Prompts

Here are some fun things to ask Claude to create:

### A Pomodoro Timer
```text
Create a Pomodoro timer with 25-minute work sessions and 5-minute breaks.
Add start, pause, and reset buttons. Show the time in a large, easy-to-read format.
```

### A Color Palette Generator
```text
Create a color palette generator that shows 5 harmonious colors.
Add a "Generate New Palette" button. Show the hex codes for each color
and let me click to copy them.
```

### A Simple Game
```text
Create a simple memory card matching game with 8 pairs of cards.
When I click two cards, show if they match. Track my number of moves.
```

### A Mood Tracker
```text
Create a mood tracker where I can click on emoji faces (😊 😐 😢 😡 😴)
to log how I'm feeling. Show a simple history of my recent moods.
```

## Why This Matters

What you just did is the core of what we'll learn in this workshop:

1. **You gave AI instructions** (a prompt)
2. **AI created something useful** (code that works)
3. **You used it immediately** (no complex setup)

The difference? **Claude Artifacts** run in your browser temporarily. In this workshop, you'll learn to:

- Create projects that **live permanently** on the internet
- Build things **on your own computer**
- Have **full control** over your code
- Share your creations with **anyone in the world**

## Ready for More?

Now that you've seen what's possible, let's set up the tools that will let you build anything you can imagine.

<div class="tip-box">
  <strong>💡 Keep that Claude tab open!</strong> You can use Artifacts to quickly prototype ideas throughout the workshop.
