## Meet Claude Artifacts

Claude has a feature called **Artifacts** that lets you create things instantly in your browser. Let's try it!

### Step 1: Open Claude

Go to [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) in your browser.

### Step 2: Ask Claude to Create Something

Copy and paste this prompt into Claude:

```text
Create a simple interactive calculator with a clean, modern design.
It should have buttons for numbers 0-9, basic operations (+, -, ×, ÷),
and equals. Make it look beautiful with rounded buttons and nice colors.
```

Press **Enter** and watch!

## Try More Prompts

Here are some fun things to ask Claude to create:

### A Pomodoro Timer
```text
Create a Pomodoro timer with 25-minute work sessions and 5-minute breaks.
Add start, pause, and reset buttons. Show the time in a large, easy-to-read format.
```

### A Color Palette Generator
```text
Create a color palette generator that shows 5 harmonious colors.
Add a "Generate New Palette" button. Show the hex codes for each color
and let me click to copy them.
```

### A Simple Game
```text
Create a simple memory card matching game with 8 pairs of cards.
When I click two cards, show if they match. Track my number of moves.
```

### A Mood Tracker
```text
Create a mood tracker where I can click on emoji faces (😊 😐 😢 😡 😴)
to log how I'm feeling. Show a simple history of my recent moods.
```

## Why This Matters

What you just did is the core of what we'll learn in this workshop:

1. **You gave AI instructions** (a prompt)
2. **AI created something useful** (code that works)
3. **You used it immediately** (no complex setup)

The difference? **Claude Artifacts** run in your browser temporarily. In this workshop, you'll learn to:

- Create projects that **live permanently** on the internet
- Build things **on your own computer**
- Have **full control** over your code
- Share your creations with **anyone in the world**
