# Why This Guide

## The Mission

This workshop exists to make AI-assisted coding accessible to everyone, regardless of technical background.

## The Problem We Saw

Traditional coding tutorials assume you already know:
- How to use a terminal
- What Git and GitHub are
- How to install development tools
- Technical jargon and concepts

But what if you are completely new to coding? What if terms like "repository," "CLI," and "deployment" sound like a foreign language?

**Most tutorials leave beginners behind.**

## Our Solution

The AI Workshop takes a different approach:

### Start with Success
You build something real in the first 10 minutes. No theory, no setup - just immediate results that prove "I can do this!"

### Plain Language
We avoid technical jargon. When we must use a technical term, we define it first. Every explanation is written as if you are learning for the very first time.

### Desktop Apps, Not Command Lines
We use GitHub Desktop and Claude Code desktop app instead of forcing you to learn terminal commands. You click buttons, not type cryptic commands.

### One Clear Path
No overwhelming options. No "you could also do it this way." Just one clear, tested path from start to finish.

### Real Projects
You build actual websites you can share, not toy examples. Your portfolio site, your business landing page, your creative project.

## Who This Is For

This workshop is designed for:

- **Complete beginners** who have never coded before
- **Curious minds** who want to see what AI can do
- **Professionals** exploring AI tools for work
- **Students** learning modern development workflows
- **Creators** who want to build without learning to code first
- **Educators** looking for beginner-friendly AI curriculum

## What Makes This Different

### AI-First Approach
We teach you to work **with** AI, not just learn coding syntax. This is how modern development works.

### No Prerequisites
Seriously. If you can use a web browser and download apps, you can do this workshop.

### Free and Open
This guide is free, open-source, and licensed for sharing. We believe knowledge should be accessible.

### Built for Non-Technical Users
Every decision - from using desktop apps to avoiding terminal commands - was made with beginners in mind.

## The Vision

We believe the future of software development is collaboration between humans and AI.

Programming should not require years of study. With AI assistance, anyone with an idea can bring it to life.

This workshop is our contribution to that future.

## Our Commitment

We promise to:
- Keep this guide free and accessible
- Use plain, simple language
- Test every step with real beginners
- Update as tools and best practices evolve
- Listen to your feedback and improve

## Join the Journey

Whether you are here to build your first website or explore what AI can do, welcome!

You are not just learning to code - you are discovering a new way to create.

Let's build something amazing together.
