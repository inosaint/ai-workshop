# GitHub Account

GitHub is where developers store their code. Think of it as **Google Drive for code**.

In this section, you'll create a free GitHub account that you'll use for the rest of the workshop.

## A crash course of terms

Before we dive in, let's understand a few terms you would need to be familiar with.

| Concept               | Everyday Analogy                                                      |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **GitHub**            | Like Google Drive(Cloud), but specifically designed for code projects |
| **Repository** (repo) | A folder that contains your project files                             |
| **Commit**            | Saving a version of your work (like "Save As" with a note)            |
| **Push**              | Uploading your saved work to the cloud                                |
| **Pull**              | Downloading the latest version from the cloud                         |

You don't need to memorize these now - they'll make more sense once we use them!
