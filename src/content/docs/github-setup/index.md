# GitHub Account

GitHub is where developers store their code. Think of it as **Google Drive for code**.

In this section, you'll create a free GitHub account that you'll use for the rest of the workshop.

## A crash course of terms

Before we dive in, let's understand a few terms you would need to be familiar with.

|Concept|Everyday Analogy|
|---|---|
|**GitHub**|Like Google Drive(Cloud), but specifically designed for code projects|
|**Repository** (repo)|A folder that contains your project files|
|**Commit**|Saving a version of your work (like "Save As" with a note)|
|**Push**|Uploading your saved work to the cloud|
|**Pull**|Downloading the latest version from the cloud|

You don't need to memorize these now - they'll make more sense once we use them!
