# GitHub Account

GitHub is where developers store their code. Think of it as **Google Drive for code** - but with superpowers.

In this section, you'll create a free GitHub account that you'll use for the rest of the workshop.

## What is GitHub?

Before we dive in, let's understand what GitHub actually is:

| Concept | Everyday Analogy |
|---------|------------------|
| **GitHub** | Like Google Drive, but specifically designed for code projects |
| **Repository** (repo) | A folder that contains your project files |
| **Commit** | Saving a version of your work (like "Save As" with a note) |
| **Push** | Uploading your saved work to the cloud |
| **Pull** | Downloading the latest version from the cloud |

You don't need to memorize these now - they'll make more sense once we use them!

## Creating Your GitHub Account

### Step 1: Go to GitHub

Open your browser and go to **[github.com](https://github.com)**

<div class="image-placeholder">
  <div class="image-placeholder-icon">🖼️</div>
  <div class="image-placeholder-text">
    <strong>[Screenshot: GitHub homepage]</strong><br/>
    The GitHub homepage with the "Sign up" button visible in the top right corner
  </div>
</div>

### Step 2: Click "Sign up"

Look for the **"Sign up"** button in the top-right corner and click it.

### Step 3: Enter Your Email

Type in your email address. This will be linked to your account, so use one you check regularly.

  <div class="image-placeholder-text">
    <strong>[Screenshot: GitHub signup - email step]</strong><br/>
    The email input field with the "Continue" button
  </div>
</div>

### Step 4: Create a Password

Choose a strong password. GitHub will show you if it's strong enough.

<div class="warning-box">
  <strong>⚠️ Important:</strong> Save this password somewhere safe! You'll need it throughout the workshop.
</div>

### Step 5: Choose a Username

This is your identity on GitHub! Some tips:
- Keep it professional (especially if you'll use this for work)
- Make it memorable
- It can be your real name, a nickname, or something creative

Examples: `johndoe`, `jane-codes`, `curious-builder`

<div class="image-placeholder">
  <div class="image-placeholder-icon">🖼️</div>
  <div class="image-placeholder-text">
    <strong>[Screenshot: GitHub signup - username step]</strong><br/>
    The username input showing validation (green checkmark if available)
  </div>
</div>

### Step 6: Verify You're Human

Complete the puzzle to prove you're not a robot. (We promise the rest of the workshop is easier than this puzzle!)

### Step 7: Verify Your Email

GitHub will send a code to your email. Check your inbox (and spam folder!) for an email from GitHub.

Enter the code to verify your account.

<div class="checkpoint">
  <div class="checkpoint-title">✅ Checkpoint</div>
  <p>You should now see the GitHub dashboard. Welcome to GitHub!</p>
</div>

## Configuring Your Profile (Optional)

While not required, adding a profile picture and bio helps others recognize you. You can skip this for now and come back later.

1. Click your profile icon (top-right corner)
2. Click **"Settings"**
3. Add a profile picture and bio if you'd like

## Understanding the GitHub Interface

Let's take a quick tour of what you'll see:

  <div class="image-placeholder-icon">🖼️</div>
  <div class="image-placeholder-text">
    <strong>[Screenshot: GitHub dashboard with annotations]</strong><br/>
    The main dashboard with labels pointing to:<br/>
    • Profile menu (top right)<br/>
    • Search bar (top center)<br/>
    • "New" button for creating repositories<br/>
    • Recent activity feed
  </div>
</div>

### Key Areas:
- **Top Bar**: Search, notifications, and your profile
- **Left Sidebar**: Your repositories and recent activity
- **"New"** (green button): Create new repositories
