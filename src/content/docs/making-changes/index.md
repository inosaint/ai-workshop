# Making Changes with Claude Code

Now that Claude Code has created your project, you'll want to make changes and improvements. Here's how!

## Making Changes

Want to tweak something? You have two options:

### Option 1: Ask Claude Code

The easiest way - just tell Claude Code what to change:

```text
Change the heading font to something more playful
```

```text
Make the buttons bigger and add rounded corners
```

```text
Add a footer with copyright information
```

### Option 2: Edit Files Yourself

You can also edit files directly using any text editor:

1. Open the file in a text editor (VS Code, Notepad++, TextEdit, etc.)
2. Make your changes
3. Save the file
4. Refresh your browser to see the changes

  <strong>💡 Pro Tip:</strong> Try making small changes yourself! If you break something, you can always ask Claude Code to fix it.

## Save Your Progress with GitHub Desktop

After making changes to your project, let's save them with GitHub Desktop:

### Step 1: Open GitHub Desktop

Switch to GitHub Desktop. You should see your new files listed in the "Changes" tab.

### Step 2: Review Your Changes

Click on the files to see what was created or modified. All the changed files should be checked.

### Step 3: Commit Your Changes

1. In the "Summary" field at the bottom left, type something that describes the changes you made
   - First time: `Initial project created with Claude Code`
   - After changes: `Updated button styles and added footer`
2. Click the **"Commit to branch"** button

### Step 4: Publish to GitHub (First Time Only)

If this is your first commit:

1. Click the **"Publish repository"** button at the top
2. Uncheck "Keep this code private" (we want it public for GitHub Pages)
3. Click **"Publish repository"**

Your project is now saved and backed up on GitHub! 🎉

### Step 5: Push Changes (After First Publish)

For subsequent changes, just click **"Push origin"** to sync your changes to GitHub.


## Best Practices

### Commit Often
Save your work frequently with meaningful commit messages. This creates a history you can refer back to.

### Test Before Committing
Always view your changes in the browser before committing to make sure they work as expected.

### Write Clear Commit Messages
Instead of "updates" or "changes", write:
- "Add contact form with validation"
- "Fix navigation menu alignment"
- "Update color scheme to blue"
