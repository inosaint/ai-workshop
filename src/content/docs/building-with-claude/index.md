This is the moment you've been waiting for! Let's use Claude Code to build your project.

### Step 1: Open a new Claude Code chat

![New Chat Setup](new-project.png)

1. Choose the repository you want Claude to work on. Eg., username/username.github.io
2. Select the default Cloud environment
3. Paste your prompt
4. (optional) Add any images for design reference


### Step 2: Watch and Learn

Claude Code will:

1. **Plan** - Think about the best approach
2. **Create files** - Generate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
3. **Explain** - Tell you what it's doing and why

### Step 3: Review What Was Created

After Claude Code finishes, let's see what files were created. Claude code would have created a new branch and pushed it's work to that branch. You will need to *fetch* those changes to your local system for review.

## Accessing Claude's Changes with Github Desktop
