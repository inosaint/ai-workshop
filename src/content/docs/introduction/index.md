That's it. No special software, no coding knowledge, no experience required.


## A Note on Making Mistakes

Here's a secret that experienced developers know:

> **Everyone makes mistakes. ALL. THE. TIME.**

When something goes wrong (and it will), that's not failure - that's learning. Every error message is a clue. Every bug is a puzzle to solve.

This workshop has a [Troubleshooting](/ai-workshop/troubleshooting/) section for common issues.
