# Welcome to the AI Workshop!

You're about to embark on an exciting journey. By the end of this workshop, you'll have:

- A real project running live on the internet
- Experience using AI to help you code
- Skills you can use to build anything you imagine

And the best part? **You don't need any prior coding experience.**

## What is Claude Code?

Think of Claude Code as a **super-smart assistant** that lives in your computer's terminal (that black window where hackers type in movies).

Instead of typing cryptic commands yourself, you can simply tell Claude Code what you want in plain English:

> "Create a simple website with a header, a photo, and three sections about my hobbies"

And Claude Code will:
1. Understand what you want
2. Write the code for you
3. Help you fix any problems
4. Explain what it's doing along the way

It's like having an experienced developer sitting next to you, ready to help 24/7.

| Personal Portfolio | A beautiful one-page website showcasing who you are |
| Interactive Quiz | A fun game that tests knowledge and shows results |
| Habit Tracker | A simple app to track daily habits and see your progress |

## A Note on Making Mistakes

Here's a secret that experienced developers know:

> **Everyone makes mistakes. ALL. THE. TIME.**

When something goes wrong (and it will), that's not failure - that's learning. Every error message is a clue. Every bug is a puzzle to solve.

This workshop has a [Troubleshooting](/ai-workshop/troubleshooting/) section for common issues. And remember: Claude Code is here to help you debug!
