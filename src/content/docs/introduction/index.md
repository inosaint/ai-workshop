You're about to embark on an exciting journey. By the end of this workshop, you'll learn:

- Familiarise yourself with the AI ecosystem
- Experience how AI can help you create
- A real project running live on the internet

And the best part? **You don't need any prior coding experience.**


## Who Is This Guide For?

Like the previous line states, this guide is written for anyone who is just a beginner and has no prior coding experience. 

When I started [vibe coding in November 2025](http://kenneth.dsouza.im/writing/vibe-coding/) and shared my projects with my friends. Many expressed interest in trying out vibecoding but I found that there wasnt any resource that helped people build on their own. Most resources, even official ones tend to be written for intermediate or expert users. 

Yes, there are AI based vibe-coding systems like Replit and Figma Make but they kinda lock you within their private platforms. So I decided to write a simple guide based on my approach towards vibe coding(a missing manual perhaps?), hoping that helps new users get a taste of vibe coding and start building.

## The Journey Ahead

Here's our roadmap:

## What You'll Need

Before we start, make sure you have:

- ✅ A computer (Windows or Mac)
- ✅ An internet connection
- ✅ About 3 hours of focused time
- ✅ Curiosity and patience!

That's it. No special software, no coding knowledge, no experience required.


## A Note on Making Mistakes

Here's a secret that experienced developers know:

> **Everyone makes mistakes. ALL. THE. TIME.**

When something goes wrong (and it will), that's not failure - that's learning. Every error message is a clue. Every bug is a puzzle to solve.

This workshop has a [Troubleshooting](/ai-workshop/troubleshooting/) section for common issues.
